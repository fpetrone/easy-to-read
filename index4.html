<h1>What is the European Parliament and how does it work</h1>

<h2>The European Parliament</h2>
<p>The Parliament represents<br />
450 million people who live in the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Union is called the EU</p>
<p>People in the EU<br /> vote for 705 members to represent them <br />in the Parliament.</p>
<p>Members of the European Parliament are called MEPs.<br />
MEPs look at plans for new EU laws.<br />
MEPs change the laws to make them better.<br />
MEPs check if the EU is working as it should.</p>
<h2>What the European Parliament does</h2>
<p>The Parliament adopts new laws <br />
 for the EU with the Council.</p>
<p>The Council represents governments of countries <br />
that are part of the EU.</p>
<p>The Parliament and the Council <br />
also decide on the EU budget.</p>
<p>The Parliament checks the work <br />
of all the organisations that help run the EU.</p>
<p>MEPs vote on trade agreements with countries <br> 
outside the EU.</p>

<h2>How the European Parliament works</h2>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>Most MEPs in the Parliament <br />
work together in political groups.</p>

<p>Groups are made up of MEPs <br />
from different countries <br />
and different political parties.</p>

<p>The groups have common aims.</p>


<h3>Committees</h3>

<p>The Parliament has 20 permanent committees.<br />
The biggest committee is the environment committee.<br />
All MEPs work in the committees.</p>


<p>Committees come up with reports on <br />
proposed new EU laws.</p>

<p>They propose improvements to laws.<br />
MEPs on the committee vote on these proposals.</p>

<h3>Plenary sessions</h3>

<p>Then the whole Parliament votes <br />
on new laws during plenary sessions.</p>

<p>Plenary sessions bring all MEPs together <br />
to debate and vote on new laws.</p>

<p>MEPs elect a president <br />
to represent the Parliament.</p>

<p>The president also chairs debates <br />
and votes in the plenary session.</p>

<p>The president is elected for <br />
two and a half years.</p>

<h2>Cast your vote</h2>

Parliament during the European elections.</p>

<p>European elections take place <br />
every five years in all EU countries.</p>


<h2>Stay informed</h2>

<p>You can follow the work of the Parliament on social media.</p>
