<h1>What is the European Parliament and how does it work</h1>

<h2>The European Parliament</h2>
<p>The European Parliament represents<br />
450 million people who live in the European Union.</p>
<p>People in the European Union<br /> vote for 705 members to represent them <br />in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Members of the European Parliament are called MEPs.<br />
MEPs look at plans for new European Union laws.<br />
MEPs change the laws to make them better.<br />
MEPs check if the European Union is working as it should.</p>
<h2>What the European Parliament does</h2>
<p>The European Parliament adopts new laws <br />
 for the European Union with the Council.</p>
<p>The Council represents governments of countries <br />
that are part of the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and the Council <br />
also decide on the European Union budget.</p>
<p>The European Parliament checks the work <br />
of all the organisations that help run the European Union.</p>
<p>MEPs vote on trade agreements with countries <br> 
outside the European Union.</p>

<h2>How the European Parliament works</h2>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>Most MEPs in the European Parliament <br />
work together in political groups.</p>

<p>Groups are made up of MEPs <br />
from different countries <br />
and different political parties.</p>

<p>The groups have common aims.</p>


<h3>Committees</h3>

<p>The European Parliament has 20 permanent committees.<br />
The biggest committee is the environment committee.<br />
All MEPs work in the committees.</p>


<p>Committees come up with reports on <p>
proposed new European Union laws.</p>

<p>They propose improvements to laws.<br />
MEPs on the committee vote on these proposals.</p>

<h3>Plenary sessions</h3>

<p>Then the whole Parliament votes <br />
on new laws during plenary sessions.</p>

<p>Plenary sessions bring all MEPs together <br />
to debate and vote on new laws.</p>

<p>MEPs elect a president <br />
to represent the European Parliament.</p>

<p>The president also chairs debates <br />
and votes in the plenary session.</p>

<p>The president is elected for <br />
two and a half years.</p>
